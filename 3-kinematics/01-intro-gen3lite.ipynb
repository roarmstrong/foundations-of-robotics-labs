    "The Kinova Gen3 Lite is a 6-DOF robot arm with a 2-DOF gripper. It is a lightweight robot arm with a small payload and reach. It is a collaborative robot, meaning that it is designed to work alongside humans. It is also a mobile robot, meaning that it can be mounted on a mobile base. The Gen3 Lite is a research platform, meaning that it is designed to be used by researchers to develop new algorithms and applications.\n",

    "## Robot Manipulators\n",
    "\n",
    "A manipulator is a mechanical system that is controlled by a set of joints. The joints are connected to each other by rigid links. The end-effector (EE) is the last link of the manipulator and it is the part of the manipulator that interacts with the environment. The kinematics of a manipulator is the study of the relationship between the joint angles and the position and orientation of the EE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of robotics and mechanical systems, a degree of freedom (DOF) refers to the number of independent ways a dynamic system can move without violating any constraint imposed on it. It is the number of parameters that determine the state of a physical system and is important to define the kinematic chain of a robot. In robotics, each joint provides one or more degrees of freedom, allowing the robot to move in a certain direction or rotate around a certain axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom (DOF) of a manipulator is the number of independent joint angles that are required to specify the position and orientation of the EE. The Gen3 Lite has 6 DOF."
