    "The first problem in navigation is to work out where you are. In robotics, localisation is the process of estimating where you are. Localisation is often based on measurements of self and the environment, and is often impossible to do perfectly. It is also often impossible to do without also solving other navigation problems such as mapping. These imperfect representations and relationships are typically represented using probability."

    "Bayes' theorem is a way of updating our beliefs about the world when we get new information. It is a way of combining our prior beliefs with new evidence to get a new, better, estimate of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of localisation, we can think of $A$ as the state of the world, and $B$ as the evidence we have observed. We can then think of $P(A)$ as our prior belief about the state of the world, and $P(A|B)$ as our posterior belief about the state of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    ">**This theorem reads as:**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Our ***posterior*** belief is based on our ***prior*** belief, moderated by the likelihood of observing evidence given our belief, and normalised by the probability of that evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In localisation this theorem is used to iteratively improve our estimate of the state of the world as we get new evidence. We start with an uncertain prior belief about the state of the world, and then update that belief as we get new evidence, and thus we slowly develop an idea of where we are."
