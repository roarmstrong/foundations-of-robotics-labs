    "## Representing the world\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent the world. For 2D environments, the most common is to use a grid. This is a 2D array of cells, where each cell represents a small area of the world. The value of each cell is a probability that the cell is occupied. This is called an occupancy grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations it is more useful to represent the world as a set of features with relationships between them. This kind of map is called a graph. Graphs are useful for representing the topology of the world, and for representing the relationships between objects in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid or Graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grids and graphs are both useful representations of the world. Grids are useful for representing the geometry of the world, and graphs are useful for representing the topology of the world. In practice, you will often use both representations at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grids are easy to use for localization, because you can easily compare the map to the sensor readings. Graphs are easy to use for planning, because you can easily find the shortest path between two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grids are memory intensive, because they require a lot of storage space. Graphs are computationally intensive, because they require a lot of computation to find the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach is to use both representations at the same time, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could use a grid to represent the immediate surroundings of the robot\n",
    "- a graph to represent the topology of nearby landmarks\n",
    "- and another lower resolution grid to represent the topology of the whole world."

    "## The Mapping Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to mapping is to make a measurement of the world. This could be a laser scan, a depth image, or a point cloud. The next step is to mark the measurement on a map. The challenge with this is deciding where to start drawing the measurement on the map. Since the measurement is relative to the robot, you need to know where the robot is on the map. This is the problem of localization. Unfortunately, the problem of localization is also the problem of mapping. This is a chicken and egg problem. You need to know where the robot is to draw the map, but you need to draw the map to know where the robot is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use a probabilistic approach. You can start with a guess of where the robot is, and then update the guess as you make measurements. This is called a Bayes filter."

This package takes laser scans as input, and outputs an occupancy grid map. The map is published as a ROS topic, and can be visualized using RViz.\n",
